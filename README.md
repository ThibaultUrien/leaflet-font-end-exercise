# Front-end Task (Drone flight planner)

This project is a personal exercise. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (and then ejected).

[Check the live demo here](https://thibaulturien.github.io/leaflet-font-end-exercise/). Wou can also clone the project and open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.

For the given prompt, it would probably have been possible to implement everything in a 500 line d3 script. But usually, in software development, once you have implemented the first set of feature, more feature arrive, more dependencies are introduced and you end up reconsidering your life choices, especially you choice of using d3.

Even id this project was a one shot prompt, it have been designed as if it would be kept being extended on the long run as this is in this situation that the difference between good code and bade code appear. Fire and forget code is always good (as long as you manage to get it bug free).

You find more on the design of the project in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](/doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)
